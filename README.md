# Joomla-Atum-Sidebar-fixed-on-scroll-using-CSS
The Sidebar Menu in the Joomla Atum Template scrolls up when open and becomes invisible as the screen scrolls down. By simply adding a single line of CSS, the Sidebar Menu will remain in its position when the screen is scrolled, ensuring it remains visible even when the screen scrolls down.
